                About hobbies!
                <div class = "flex-container-5">
                    I love playing video games to unwind since they don't take much thinking power. I spend most
                    of my time playing Stardew Valley or Sims, when I want to play with my friends we usually turn on Minecraft.
                    I also love to listen to music and even though I do not play an instrument I love to make and organize playlists. My favorite
                    artist has been Childish Gambino ever since I was little and hope to see him in concert before he finally retires. I have been to multiple
                    other concerts and have found that I'm willing to pay however much to see one of my favorite muscicians live.
                    And lastly, I love to binge romantic comedies, specifically those that fall under the category of anime. They are very lighthearted
                    and I find they have the best plots. My favorites include Kamisama Kiss and Ao Haru Ride.
