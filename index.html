                About me!
                <div class = "flex-container-5">
                    I was born and raised in Seattle, Washington then traveled  to Atlanta, Georgia, to recieve my college
                    education. I attended Cleveland High School STEM where I learned what STEM meant and the different pathways
                    I could pursue. At my high school we were expected to pick between two STEM pathways, biology or engineering.
                    Being that I couldn't stand the sight of blood, I began my engineering courses. It was my programming principles
                    class that gave me insight on what career would potentially suit my interests. With the many projects and concepts
                    you can learn in computer science I knew that I would never be bored. It wasn't until I reached Clark Atlanta University
                    that I narrowed down what exactly I wanted to do in the field and that was Information Sciences/Cyber Security. It was
                    thanks to my schooling and program experiences that I gained my goal, to become a Solutions Architect. I plan to learn
                    more about the subject through opportunities available to me so that I can apply the knowledge in the future.
